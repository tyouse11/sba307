Project Title:
SBA 307 - 3-page Website

Description:
This project includes a very basic 3-page website that sells a product. The website consists of a Home page, Shop page, About page, and Contact (non-functional) page. 

Getting Started - Dependencies:
To create this project I used macOS when I downloaded Visual Studio Code to write the code. 
I used a variation of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Bootstrap to complete the project


Executing the program:
- This website sells a product
- When you open the home page, you see a navigation bar where you can choose to either go to the Home page (current page), Shop, About, or Contact page. Additionally there is an option to search for a product
- There is a gif that is from and center to catch the user's attention about the product
- under that is a few products for easy access to the most popular items. These items have an animation of spinning when the user hovers over them
-On the Shop page, in addtion to the navigation bar which is present on each page, there is a thumbnail list of the items for sale. Each item has a picture of the item, the items name, a short description of the item, and a button for the user to add the item to their cart.
- The About page has a dropdown menu of how the user would like the table of products to be viewed. At the moment this dropdown menu is non-functional. 
- The table on the about page consists of all of the products in a list view
- The contact page is non-functional but would include different ways to contact the company
